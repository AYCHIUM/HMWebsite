# Hospital-Management-website
**A sample website which demonstrates how the common activities related to a hospital can be managed.**

This website is a project which was undertaken by me as a Database Management Systems project while studying in my 5th Semester CSE course.
**It has been developed on a Linux Mint OS, with the help of an Apache2 server, a MySQL database server and PHP 7 (or LAMP). Javascript has been used to validate some of the fields while taking in form input.**

The folder labelled 'css' has all the .css files. The 'img' folder has all the images which were used to build the website.
The other folders labelled 'db_tables' and 'OutputScreenshots' have the pictures of the major Databases tables used to build this website and the screenshots of the website respectively.
The 'mysql_commands' file has the list of commands to be typed at the terminal to make the the website becomes functional.

**The website has the following funtionalities**:
1. Administrator Login
2. Receptionist Login
3. Doctor Login
4. Patient Login
5. Take appointments and quick consultational appointments as well
6. Admit new patients
7. Generate multiple bills and discharge patients
8. Add new employees
9. Doctors can prescribe drugs for patients assigned to them.
10. View room allocation and availability

**P.S.:**
1. Enter your MySQL password, wherever mentioned, in the PHP files before using them.
2. Use the Google Chrome web browser for better results.
3. Use 'admin' as both the username and password for the Adminstrator's login.
4. Use 'reception' as both the username and password for the Receptionist's login.
